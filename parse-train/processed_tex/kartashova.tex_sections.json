        "doco:introduction": "\nBy a {\\it unary algebra} one means an algebra whose signature consists of unary symbols. Every unary algebra can be treated as an outputless automation, an act or a digraph. Unlike classical algebras, i.e. groups, rings and so forth, unary algebras have some specific properties. Therefore, their research is  quite important for the development of theory of algebraic systems.  A significant place in their research is occupied by  lattices related to algebras.  Among them, there are, for example,  lattices of subalgebras, congruence lattices, topology lattices, etc. These lattices give considerable information conserning the properties of the  algebras  themselves.\n\nInvestigations are rather well developed in the case of lattices related to unars, i.e. algebras with a single unary operation. Conditions under which the congruence lattice of a unar is distributive, modular, complemented, or is a chain were given in \\cite{1} and \\cite{2}. The unars whose topology lattices have such properties were characterized in \\cite{3}.\n\nThese problems turned out to be much more complicated for unary algebras whose signature contains more than one operation (see, e.g., \\cite{4}, \\cite{5}). Some necessary conditions for distributivity or modularity of a congruence (topology) lattice  of a commutative unary algebra were found in \\cite{5}. The commutative unary\nalgebras whose congruence (topology) lattices are chains were described in \\cite{6}  and \\cite{7}.\n\n\nIn this paper  the commutative unary algebras  whose nontrivial congruences (topologies) form an antichain (i.e. pairwise incomparable)  are characterized.\nWe also  describe  the  class of all lattices represented as a congruence (topology) lattice  of  a commutative unary algebra with such property.\n\n\n",

            "\nLet $\\mathfrak{A} =  \\langle A,\\Omega\\rangle$ be an arbitrary unary algebra. Denote by $\\Omega^{*}$ the free monoid of words with generating set\n $\\Omega$ with respect to composition.\n The empty word $\\emptyset$ is the identity element of $\\Omega^{*}$.\n\nIn what follows, everywhere  ${\\bf{N}}$ denotes the set of positive integers  and ${\\bf{N}}_0 =  {\\bf{N}}\\cup \\{0\\}$.\nThe result $w(a)$ of applying a word  $w\\in\\Omega^{*}$ to an element\n$a\\in A$ is defined by induction on the length of the word $w$(see \\cite[p. 142]{8}). Hence, if $w=w_1w_2$, then $w(a) = w_1(w_2(a))$,\nwhere $w, w_1, w_2\\in\\Omega^*$ and $a\\in A$.\nBy definition, we also set $f^0(a) =\\emptyset a =a$ and $f^{n}(a)\n= f(f^{n-1}(a))$ for arbitrary $f\\in\\Omega$, $a\\in A$, and\n$n\\in{\\bf{N}}$.\n\nFor every word $u\\in\\Omega^{*}$, define a mapping $\\delta_u: A\\to A$\nby the equation  $ \\delta_u(a) = u(a) $ for any $a\\in A$. The set\n$\\{ \\delta_u | u\\in \\Omega^*\\}$ forms a semigroup $S(\\mathfrak{A})$\nwith respect to composition. This semigroup is referred to as the\n {\\it characteristic semigroup of the unary algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}$}(see \\cite{9}).\n\nA unary algebra $\\mathfrak{A} = \\langle A,\\Omega\\rangle$ is said to be\n {\\it commutative} if   $f(g(a))=g(f(a))$ for any\n$f, g\\in\\Omega$ and $a\\in A$.\nFor every element $a$ of an arbitrary unary algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}$, denote by $(a)$ the subalgebra generated by the element $a$.\n\nObviously, for every commutative unary algebra $\\mathfrak{A} = \\langle A, \\Omega\\rangle$, the binary relation\n $\\eta = \\{(a,\nb)\\in A\\times A | (a)\\cap (b)\\ne\\emptyset\\}\n$\nis a congruence of this algebra.\nThe classes of this congruence are said to be {\\it connected components}\nof the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$. It can easily be shown that every connected component is a subalgebra of the algebra.\n\n\nA commutative unary algebra is called\n {\\it connected} if it has precisely one\nconnected component.\nA commutative unary algebra is said to be\n {\\it strongly connected} if it is generated by each of its elements.\n\n\n\nBelow we denote by $Con\\mathfrak{A}$ and $Sub\\mathfrak{A}$  the lattice of subalgebras and congruence lattice of the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$, respectively.\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n Let $\\mathfrak{A} = \\langle A,\\Omega\\rangle$ be a strongly connected commutative unary algebra.

Applying Lemma 1, we complete the proof of Lemma 2.\n\\Endproof\nLet $\\mathfrak{B} = \\langle B, \\Omega\\rangle$ be a subalgebra of a\nunary algebra $\\mathfrak{A} = \\langle A, \\Omega\\rangle$. Then by a\n{\\it Rees congruence}$R(\\mathfrak{B})$ one means  (see, e.g.,\n\\cite[p. 35]{11})  the congruence of the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$\ndefined by the rule $ aR(\\mathfrak{B})b\\Leftrightarrow (a =b)\\lor\\\n\\{a, b\\}\\subseteq B $ for any $a,b\\in A$.

If $\\mathfrak{A}$ is not\nconnected, then this algebra is either a union of three loops or has\nprecisely two connected components, and at least one of them is a\nsingleton component.\n\\end{lemma}{\\em Proof.}\nLet  $\\mathfrak{A}_1$, $\\mathfrak{A}_2$,\n$\\mathfrak{A}_3$, $\\mathfrak{A}_4$ be distinct connected components of the algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}$.

Then $0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\ne\nR(\\mathfrak{A}_1)\\subset R(\\mathfrak{A}_1  + \\mathfrak{A}_2 )\\ne\n1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}$,   which  contradicts the assumption again.\n\nSuppose that the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$ has two distinct connected\ncomponents,    ${|\\mathfrak{A}_1| > 1}$,  and $|\\mathfrak{A}_2| >\n1$. Then we have $0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\ne R(\\mathfrak{A}_1)\\subset\nR(\\mathfrak{A}_1)\\vee  R(\\mathfrak{A}_2 )\\ne 1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}$.\nThis contradiction proves the lemma. \\Endproof\nObviously, if a commutative unary algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$ has the\nsmallest subalgebra with respect  to inclusion, then this subalgebra\nis strongly connected. We refer to this subalgebra as the  {\\it\nkernel} of the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$.\n\nIt can readily be seen that for any commutative unary  algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}=\\langle A,\\Omega\\rangle$, the binary relation\n $\n\\zeta  = \\{(a, b)\\in A\\times A | (a) = (b)\\}\n$\non the set $A$ is a congruence of this algebra.\n\n\n\n The class of the congruence $\\zeta$ with a generating element\n$a\\in A$ is called {\\it the fiber} of this element and is denoted by\n $L_a$(\\cite{12}). For every element $a$  of\n$\\mathfrak{A}$, write $\\Omega_a = \\{ f\\in\\Omega | f(a)\\in L_a\\}$.\nNote that $\\Omega_a =  \\Omega_b$  if  $b\\in L_a$.\n\n\n\n \\begin{lemma}\nLet a connected commutative unary algebra  $\\mathfrak{A}$ with pairwise incomparable nontrivial congruences be not strongly connected, and let this  algebra have a nonsingleton kernel $B$. Then $|A\\setminus B| = 1$.\n\\end{lemma}{\\em Proof.} Suppose that there is an element $a\\in A\\setminus B$ such that $|L_a|>1$.  Then $R(B) \\ne\\zeta$. On the other hand, the congruences $R(B)$ and $\\zeta$ are nontrivial, because $|B|>1$ and\n$B\\ne A$. However $R(B) \\subset \\zeta$, which contradicts the assumption.\n%$$0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\ne R(B)\\subset \\zeta \\ne 1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}},$$\nNow, let  $a, b\\in A\\setminus B$, $a\\ne b$, and $|L_a| = |L_b| =1$.\nThen $(a, b)\\notin\\zeta$. Therefore, we have either $a\\notin (b)$ or $b\\notin (a)$.\nTo be definite, assume that $b\\notin (a)$. Then $R(a)\\ne 1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}$.\nHence, $0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\ne R(B) \\subset R(a) \\ne 1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}},$\nwhich  contradicts the assumption again.\nThis implies that $|A\\setminus B| = 1$. \\Endproof",
            "\nDenote by $\\mathfrak{M}_{\\alpha}$ an arbitrary lattice  $L$ with the\nleast element  $0$ and  the greatest element  $1$ such that all its\nelements from $L\\setminus\\{0, 1\\}$ are pairwise incomparable and\n$|L\\setminus\\{0, 1\\}| = \\alpha$.\n\n\nIn what follows, a singly generated unary algebra $\\langle A,\nf\\rangle$   with the generating element $a$ and the defining\nrelation $f^n(a) = f^{n+m}(a)$, where $n \\ge 0$ and ${m>0}$, is\ndenoted by $C^n_m$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n Let $\\mathfrak{A} = \\langle A,\n\\Omega\\rangle$ be a commutative unary algebra.

Hence,\nnontrivial congruences of  $\\mathfrak{A}$ are pairwise incomparable.\n\n\nIn view of  Lemmas 1 and 2, each of  conditions 2) and 3) is\nsuffitient for  the set of all nontrivial congruences of the algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}$ to form an antichain.\n\nSuppose that condition 4) holds. An immediate verification shows\nthat the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$ has  only two nontrivial congruences\n$\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$, where $\\theta_1$ is the kernel of the\nendomorphism $f$ and $\\theta_2 = R(B)$($B$ is the kernel of the\nalgebra $\\mathfrak{A}$). Obviously, $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are\nnot comparable by inclusion.\n\n{\\em II. Necessity.} Let all nontrivial congruences of the algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}$ be pairwise incomparable. If this algebra has more\nthan two connected components, then  $|A| =3$  by Lemma 3.\n\nSuppose now that  $\\mathfrak{A}$ is connected. If this algebra\ndidn't have the kernel, then there would exist an infinite  chain of\nsubalgebras of this algebra.  The Rees congruences related to these\nsubalgebras would form a chain as well, which would contradict the\nassumption. This means that $\\mathfrak{A}$ has the kernel. Denote it\nby  $\\mathfrak{B}$.\n\nIf $\\mathfrak{B} = \\mathfrak{A}$, then  $\\mathfrak{A}$ is a strongly\nconnected algebra. By Lemma 1, condition 2) holds. Let $\\mathfrak{B}\n\\ne \\mathfrak{A}$ and\n $|\\mathfrak{B}|>1$.\nWe claim that there is an operation $f\\in\\Omega$ such that the reduct $\\langle\nA, f\\rangle$ of the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$ is isomorphic to an algebra of the form\n$C_p^1$, where $p$ is a prime.\nTo this end, define  the mapping $\\varphi: Con\\mathfrak{B}\\to Con\\mathfrak{A}$ by the rule\n$\n\\varphi(\\theta) = \\{ (a, b) \\in A\\times A | (a, b) \\in \\theta\\vee (a =b)\\}\n$\nfor any $\\theta\\in Con\\mathfrak{B}$.\nObviously, $1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\notin\\varphi(Con\\mathfrak{B})$ and\n$\n\\theta_1\\leq \\theta_2$ if and only if $\\varphi(\\theta_1)\\leq \\varphi(\\theta_2)\n$\nfor all $\\theta_1, \\theta_2\\in Con\\mathfrak{B}$.\n\nTherefore,  $|Con\\mathfrak{B}| = 2$, because there are no comparable\nnontrivial congruences  of the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$. Hence, using\nLemma 1, we have  $|\\mathfrak{B}|=p$, where $p$ is a prime.\nConsequently, $|S(\\mathfrak{B})| = p$ by Theorem 1 in \\cite{9}.\nSince the family of elements of the form  $\\delta_g$, where\n$g\\in\\Omega$, is a generating system for $S(\\mathfrak{B})$ and $p$\nis a prime, it follows that there is an operation $f\\in\\Omega$ for\nwhich the order  $\\delta_f$ is equal to $p$. This implies that the\nreduct $\\langle B, f\\rangle$ of the algebra $\\mathfrak{B}$ is\nisomorphic to $C^0_p$. Moreover, $|A\\setminus B| = 1$ by Lemma 4.\nLet $A\\setminus B = \\{ a\\}$.  If $f(a) =a$, then   $f$ is the\nidentity operation $\\mathfrak{A}$, which contradicts the condition\n$\\langle B, f\\rangle\\cong C^0_p$. Thus, the reduct $\\langle A,\nf\\rangle$  is isomorphic to $C_p^1$.\n\n Let  $\\mathfrak{B}= \\{e\\}$. Let us first suppose that for any\n  $x\\in \\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$, the  fiber $L_x$ coincides  with\n$\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$. Then  $\\langle A\\setminus\\{e\\},\n\\Omega_x\\rangle$ is a strongly  connected algebra and $\\mathfrak{A}$\nis obtained from   $\\langle A\\setminus\\{e\\}, \\Omega_x\\rangle$ by\nadjoining a loop. By Proposition 1 in \\cite{6},\n$|Con\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}|\\leq 2$, whence either\n$|\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}| =1$ or  $|\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}|\n= p$, where $p$ is a prime.\n\nNow let the fiber $L_x$ be a singleton for any element\n$x\\in\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$. If $|\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}| >\n2$, then choose distinct elements $a, b, c$ from the  set\n$\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$.  Since the set\n$Con\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}},1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\}$\nis an  antichain, it follows that the set\n$Sub\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{0_{Sub\\mathfrak{A}}, \\mathfrak{A}\\}$ is\nalso an antichain.  Therefore, $(a)\\cup (b) = (a)\\cup (c) = (b)\\cup\n(c) = A$, whence $(a) = (b)$, which contradicts the condition $|L_a|\n= 1$. This means that $|\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}|\\leq 2$, i.e.\n$|\\mathfrak{A}|\\leq 3$.\n\nIt remains to consider the case  $\\{ a\\}\\ne L_a\\ne \\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$ for some element\n$a\\in \\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$.\nThen there exist   $b, c\\in\\mathfrak{A}\\setminus\\{e\\}$ such that $b\\in L_a$, $a\\ne b$, and $c\\notin L_a$.\n  Therefore, either $a\\notin (c)$ or  $c\\notin (a)$.\nIf $a\\notin (c)$, then $(a, c)\\notin \\zeta\\vee R(c)$, $(a, e)\\in\n\\zeta\\vee R(c)$, $(a, e)\\notin \\zeta$, whence $\n0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\subset\\zeta\\subset\\zeta\\vee R(c)\\ne\n1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}, $ which contradicts the assumption. If\n$c\\notin (a)$, then $\n0_{Con\\mathfrak{A}}\\subset\\zeta\\subset\\zeta\\vee R(a)\\ne\n1_{Con\\mathfrak{A}},$ which contradicts the assumption again.\n\nFinally, let  $\\mathfrak{A}$ have precisely  two connected\ncomponents. Then, by Lemma 3,    $\\mathfrak{A}$ is obtained from\nsome strongly connected algebra $\\mathfrak{B}$ by adjoining a loop.\nHence, by Lemma 2, either  $|B|\\leq 2$ or  $\\mathfrak{B}$ is a\nstrongly connected algebra of a prime order. \\Endproof\nConsider similar problems for the class of topology lattices of commutative unary algebras.\n\nSuppose $\\mathfrak{A} = \\langle A, \\Omega\\rangle$ is an  algebra,\n$F\\in\\Omega$, the arity of $F$ is equal to $n$, and\n $\\sigma$ is a topology on the set $A$. Then the operation  $F$ is\n  said to be {\\it continuous relative to the topology}$\\sigma$ if for all elements $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\in A$ and an\narbitrary neighborhood $U$ of the element $F(a_1, a_2, \\ldots,\na_n)$, there exist neighborhoods $U_1, U_2, \\ldots,U_n$ of the\nelements $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, respectively, such that $F(U_1,\nU_2, \\ldots, U_n)\\subseteq U$.  A topology on the set $A$ is called\n{\\it a topology on  the algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$} if each operation\nfrom $\\Omega$ is continuous relative to this topology. It can\nreadily be seen that the set of all topologies on an algebra\n$\\mathfrak{A}$ forms a complete lattice under inclusion.

To\nthis end, choose  a generating system  $a, b$ for the group $G = Z_p\n+ Z_p$. Note that an elementary translation of $G_T$ is a\ncomposition of the translations   $f_a$ and $f_b$, where $ f_a(g) =\nag, f_b(g) = bg$ for any $g\\in G$.\n\nHence,$ConG_T\\cong Con\\mathfrak{B}$ and $\\Im (G_T)\\cong\n\\Im(\\mathfrak{B})$,  where $\\mathfrak{B} =\\langle G, f_a,\nf_b\\rangle$. Thus  $Con\\mathfrak{B}\\cong\\mathfrak{M}_{p+1}$ and\n$\\Im(\\mathfrak{B})\\cong\\mathfrak{M}_{p+1}$. \\Endproof\\begin{corollary}\nSuppose  $\\alpha$ is a cardinal. Then the lattice\n$\\mathfrak{M}_{\\alpha}$ is isomorphic  to the congruence  lattice of\nsome unar if and only if  $\\alpha\\leq 3$.\n\\end{corollary}{\\em Proof.} As was mentioned above,\n$Con(C^0_1+C^0_1+C^0_1)\\cong\\mathfrak{M}_{3}$ and\n$ConC^1_p\\cong\\mathfrak{M}_{2}$. Let now the lattice\n$\\mathfrak{M}_{\\alpha}$  be isomorphic to the congruence lattice of\nsome strongly connected unar $\\mathfrak{A}$.  Then\n$\\mathfrak{A}\\cong C_n^0$ for some integer $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. Hence,\nby Lemma 2 in \\cite{14},  $Con\\mathfrak{A}$ is isomorphic to the\nlattice of divisors of  $n$. This means that $\\alpha\\leq 2$.\n\\Endproof\nUsing Proposition 1 in \\cite{13} and Corollary 3, we obtain the following assertion.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\nSuppose  $\\alpha$ is a cardinal. Then the lattice\n$\\mathfrak{M}_{\\alpha}$ is  isomorphic to the topology  lattice of\nsome unar if and only if  $\\alpha\\leq 2$.\n\\end{corollary}\\Endproof%\\centerline{\\sc References}"
