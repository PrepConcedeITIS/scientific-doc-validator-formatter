Denote by $H^G=<H^g\\mid g\\in G>$ the subgroup generated by all subgroups of\n$G$ conjugate to $H$. We write $[A]B$ for a semidirect product of some\nsubgroups $A$ and $B$ with the normal subgroup~$A$. The Frattini and Fitting\nsubgroups are denote by $\\Phi (G)$ and $F(G)$ respectively, while\n$S(G)$ and $O_r(G)$~stand for the largest normal solvable\nsubgroup of $G$ and \ufffd the largest normal $r$-subgroup of $G$ respectively.\n\nFix a prime $r\\in \\pi (G)$. If $G$ includes a normal Sylow $r$-subgroup, then\n$G$ is called $r$-closed. If $G$ includes a normal $r^\\prime$-Hall subgroup,\nthen $G$ is called $r$-nilpotent. A group $G$ is said to be $r$-decomposable if\nit is simultaneously $r$-closed and $r$-nilpotent. A group the quotients\nof whose chief series are either of order $r$ or are $r^\\prime$-groups is called\n$r$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}supersolvable.\n\nConsider a group $G$ with\n$|G|=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2} \\ldots p_k^{a_k}, \\\np_1>p_2> \\ldots >p_k, \\ a_i\\in \\mathbb N.$\nWe say that $G$ has a Sylow tower of supersolvable type whenewer there exists a chain\nof subgroups $1=G_0\\subset G_1\\subset G_2\\subset \\ldots \\subset G_{k-1}\\subset G_k=G$\nsuch that for all $i$ the subgroup $G_i$ is normal in $G$ and the quotient\n$G_{i}/G_{i-1}$ is isomorphic to the Sylow $p_i$-subgroup of $G$.\n\nIf $H$~is a subgroup of $G$, then the core of $H$ in $G$, denoted by\n$\n\\mbox{Core}_GH=\\bigcap _{x\\in G}x^{-1}Hx\n$\nis the largest normal subgroup of $G$ containing in $H$. A group that\ncontains a maximal subgroup with the trivial core is called primitive.\nThe general properties of primitive groups are described in \\cite[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd II]{Hup}.\n\n\\medskip\nIt is easy to verify the following statement.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet $\\frak F$~be a saturated formation and let $G$~be\na group outside of $\\frak F$. If $G/N\\in \\frak F$ for every normal nontrivial\nsubgroup $N$ of $G$, then $G$ is a primitive group.\n\\end{lemma}\nWe often use the following well-known result.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet $A$ and $B$~be subgroups of $G$\nsuch that $G=AB$. If $A\\cap B$ contains a normal subgroup $D$\nof $A$, then $D^G\\subseteq \\mbox{Core}_GB$.\n\\end{lemma}\\begin{lemma}\nGiven a prime $r$ and an $r$-subgroup $R$~of $G$.\nIf $|G:N_G(R)|=r^a$, where $N_G(R)$~is the normalizer of $R$ in $G$,\nthen $R\\subseteq O_r(G)$.\n\\end{lemma}{\\em Proof.}  Let $G_r$~be a Sylow $r$-subgroup of $G$, which includes\n$R$. Then $G=N_G(R)G_r$ and $R^G\\subseteq G_r$ by Lemma 2.\nTherefore, $R\\subseteq O_r(G)$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet $r$ be the smallest prime divisor of the order of\n$G$. Then $G$ is $r$-supersolvable if and only if it is\n$r$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}nilpotent.\n\\end{lemma}{\\em Proof.} It is clear that every $r$-nilpotent group is\n$r$-supersolvable. Conversely, suppose that $G$ is $r$-supersolvable and\nlet $r$~be the smallest prime divisor of the order of $G$.\nIt follows that $G$ is solvable.\nWorking by induction on $|G|$, we have $O_{r^\\prime}(G)=1$.\nSince the class of all $r$-nilpotent groups is a saturated formation,\nwe have $\\Phi(G)=1$, and $G$ has the unique minimal normal subgroup $F=F(G)$.\nBy hypothesis, $G$ is $r$-supersolvable, thus $|F|=r$, $C_G(F)=F$.\nConsequently, $G/F$ is a cyclic group of order dividing $r-1$. This\ncontradicts the fact that $r$~is the smallest prime divisor of $|G|$, Hence,\n$F=G$. The proof of the lemma is complete.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet $r$ be the greatest prime divisor of the order of\n$G$ and let $R$~be a Sylow $r$-subgroup of $G$. Assume that\n$R$ is not normal in $G$, and that $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of $G$ with\n$N_G(R)\\subseteq K\\subseteq H$. Then $|H:K|$ is not a prime number.\n\\end{lemma}{\\em Proof.}\nIt is clear that $N_G(R)=N_K(R)=N_H(R)$ and that $R$ is a Sylow\n$r$-subgroup of both $K$ and $H$. Using the fact that\n$\n|H:N_H(R)|=|H:K|\\ |K:N_K(R)|,\n$\nand applying Sylow's theorem, we have\n$$\n|H:N_H(R)|=1+hr, \\ |K:N_K(R)|=1+kr, \\ h, \\ k\\in \\Bbb N\\cup \\{0\\}.\n$$\nLet $|H:K|=t$. Then\n$1+hr=t(1+kr), \\ t=1+(h-tk)r.$\nWe see that $r$ divides $t-1$, so $t>r$.

Since $A$ is a\n$\\Bbb P$-subnormal subgroup of $G$, there exists a chain of subgroups\n$$\nA=A_0\\subset A_1\\subset \\ldots \\subset A_{t-1}\\subset A_t=G, \\\n|A_i:A_{i-1}|\\in \\Bbb P, \\ 1\\le i\\le t.\n$$\nSince $|A_1:A_0|\\in \\Bbb P$, it follows that $|A_1|=aq$, $r>q$, or $|A_1|=ar$.\nIf $|A_1|=aq$, $r>q$, this contradicts Lemma 5.\nIf $|A_1|=ar$, then $R\\subseteq O_r(A_1)$ by Lemma 3.\nSuppose that we already know that $R$ is subnormal in $A_j$.\nThen $R\\subseteq O_r(A_j)$. Since $|A_{j+1}:A_j|\\in \\Bbb P$,\nit follows that $|A_{j+1}|=r|A_j|$ or $|A_{j+1}|=q|A_j|$, $r>q$. If\n$|A_{j+1}|=r|A_j|$, then by Lemma 3, $O_r(A_j)\\subseteq O_r(A_{j+1})$, and $R$\nis subnormal in $A_{j+1}$. Assume now that $|A_{j+1}|=q|A_j|$, $r>q$.\nConsidering the representation of $A_{j+1}$ by permutations on the right\ncosets of $A_j$, according to \\cite[I.6.2]{Hup} we infer that\n$A_{j+1}/\\mbox{Core}_{A_{j+1}}A_j$ is isomorphic to a subgroup ot the\nsymmetric group $S_q$, and  that a Sylow $r$-subgroup $X$ of $A_{j+1}$\nlies in $\\mbox{Core}_{A_{j+1}}A_j$. Thus,\n$$\nR\\subseteq O_r(A_j)\\subseteq O_r(A_{j+1})\\subseteq X\\subseteq \\mbox{Core}_{A_{j+1}}A_j.\n$$\nSince $R$ is subnormal in $A_j$, it follows that $R$ is subnormal in\n$\\mbox{Core}_{A_{j+1}}A_j$, and since $\\mbox{Core}_{A_{j+1}}A_j$ is normal in\n$A_{j+1}$, it follows that $R$ is subnormal in $A_{j+1}$. Thus, $R$ is subnormal in\n$A_i$ for every $i$; hence $R$ is subnomal in $G$. The proof of the lemma is complete.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n(\\cite[Theorem 7.2.5]{LS})\nIf two subgroups $A$ and $B$ of $G$ satisfy $AB^x=B^xA$ for all\n$x\\in G$, then the subgroup $A^B\\cap B^A$ is subnormal in $G$.\n\\end{lemma}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%",

The definition of $\\Bbb P$-subnormality implies\nthat $|G:A|=p$, $|G:B|=q$, where $p$ and $q$~are primes.\n\n%\\medskip(3) Completion of the proof.\n\nFor definiteness, assume that $p\\ge q$.  Since $\\mbox{Core}_GA=1$, according to \\cite[I.6.2]{Hup},\nthe representation of $G$ by permutations on the left cosets of $A$,\nis exact of degree $p$. So $G$ is ismorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group\n$S_p$ of order $p!=1\\cdot 2\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p$. Hence, a Sylow\n$p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$ has order $p$, where $p$ does not divide $|A|$.\nSimilarly, the representation of $G$ by permutations on the left cosets of $B$,\nis exact of degree $q$. So $G$ is ismorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group\n$S_q$ of order $q!=1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot q$.\nTherefore, a Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ of $G$ has order $q$, where $q$\ndoes not divide $|B|$. If $p=q$, then $p$ does not divide $|AB|=|G|$,\nand we derive a contradiction. So $p>q$. In this case, $p$-subgroup $P$ of $G$\nis contained in $S_q$. However, this is impossible.\nClaim 1 of the theorem is proved.\n\n2.  Let $r$~be the smallest prime divisor of $|G|$ and let $A$ and $B$ be\n$r$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}nilpotent subgroups. Check that $G$ is also $r$-nilpotent.\nClaim 1 of the theorem implies that $G$ is $r$-solvable, and\nby the minimality of $r\\in \\pi (G)$, it follows that $G$ is solvable.\nBy Lemma 6, all quotients of $G$ satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem;\ntherefore, taking Lemma 1 into account, we may assume that $O_{r\\prime}(G)=1$\nand $G$ is a primitive group. As in the proof of claim 1 of the\ntheorem, we deduce that $A$ and $B$~are maximal subgroups of $G$.\nSince $A$ and $B$ are $\\Bbb P$-subnormal subgroups of $G$, it follows that\n$|G:A|=p$ and $|G:B|=q$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes.\nSince $G$ is primitive, it has the unique minimal normal subgroup $N$ and\n$\n\\Phi (G)=1, \\ N=F(G)=O_r(G)=C_G(N),\n$\naccording to \\cite[II.3.2]{Hup}.\nIf $N$ does not lie in $A$, then\n$$\nG=[N]A, \\ p=|G:A|=|N|=r,\n$$\nbecause $N$~is an $r$-subgroup. Hence $G/N$ is isomorphic to a subgroup\nof the automorphism group of $N$, which is a cyclic group of order\n$r-1$, this contradicts the minimality of $r\\in\\pi (G)$.\nTherefore, $N$ is contained in $A$, and we have\n$A_{r^\\prime}\\subseteq C_G(N)=N$, it follows that $A_{r^\\prime}=1$.\nSimilarly, $N$ is contained in $B$, and we get\n$B_{r^\\prime}\\subseteq C_G(N)=N$,\nit follows that $B_{r^\\prime}=1$. Therefore, $G$ is an $r$-group.\nClaim 2 of the theorem is proved.\n\n%\\medskip\n3. Let $r$ be the largest prime divisor of $|G|$, and let\n$A$ and $B$~be some $r$-closed $\\Bbb P$-subnormal subgroups of $G$ such that $G=AB$.\nAccording to \\cite[VI.4.7]{Hup}, we infer that $A_rB_r$~is a Sylow $r$-subgroup of $G$,\nwhere $A_r$ and $B_r$~are Sylow $r$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}subgroups of $A$ and $B$ respectively.\nLemma 8 implies that $A_r$ is a subnormal subgroup of $G$. Similarly,\n$B_r$ is a subnormal subgroup of $G$. Therefore, $A_rB_r$ is a subnormal subgroup of $G$,\nand it follows that $G$ is $r$-closed.\n\n%\\medskip\n4. Let $r$ be the greatest prime divisor of the order of $G$ and let\n$A$ and $B$ be some $r$-decomposable subgroups of $G$. Assertion 3 of the\ntheorem implies that $G$ is $r$-closed. We need to check that $G$ is $r$-supersolvable.\nSince the class of $r$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}supersolvable groups is a saturated\nformation, Lemma 1 implies that $G$ is a primitive group, and\n$\\Phi (G)=O_{r^\\prime}(G)=1.$\nSince $G$ is $r$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}closed and primrtive, we have\n$N=O_r(G)=A_rB_r=F(G)=C_G(N)$\nand $N$ is the unique minimal normal subgroup of $G$.\nTake a complement $M$~to $N$ in $G$. Then $M$~is a maximal subgroup of\n$G$, and $\\mbox{Core}_GM=1$.\n\nAssume that $N=A_r$. Then $N=A$, while $B$~is a maximal subgroup,\nand $|N|=r$ since $B$~is a  $\\Bbb P$\\nobreakdash-\\hspace{0pt}subnormal\nsubgroup of $G$. But now $G$ is $r$-supersolvable. Therefore,\n$A_r\\ne N$, and similarly $N\\ne B_r$.\n\nIf $A_r\\cap B_r\\ne 1$, then\n$C_G(A_r\\cap B_r)\\supseteq <A,B>=G$,\nand this contradicts the fact that $N$~is a minimal normal subgroup of $G$.\nThus, $A_r\\cap B_r=1$.\n\nSince $A$ and $B$ are $r$-decomposable, it follows that\n$A=A_r\\times A_{r^\\prime},  \\  B=B_r\\times B_{r^\\prime}$.\nIf $A_{r^\\prime}=1$, then $B_r$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, this is a\ncontradiction. Therefore, $A_{r^\\prime}\\ne 1\\ne B_{r^\\prime}$.\n\nTake an arbitrary element $g=ab\\in G$, where $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$.\nThen\n$$\nA_{r^\\prime}^gB_{r^\\prime}=A_{r^\\prime}^bB_{r^\\prime}=\nB_{r^\\prime}A_{r^\\prime}^b=B_{r^\\prime}A_{r^\\prime}^g.\n$$\nApplying Lemma 9 to $A_{r^\\prime}$ and $B_{r^\\prime}$,\nwe see that $r^\\prime$-subgroup\n$A_{r^\\prime}^{B_{r^\\prime}}\\cap B_{r^\\prime}^{A_{r^\\prime}}\n$ is subnormal in the  $G$. Since $O_{r^\\prime}(G)=1$, it follows that\n$A_{r^\\prime}^{B_{r^\\prime}}\\cap B_{r^\\prime}^{A_{r^\\prime}}=1.$\nSince $A_{r^\\prime}^{B_{r^\\prime}}$ is normal in $A_{r^\\prime}{B_{r^\\prime}}$, and\n$B_{r^\\prime}^{A_{r^\\prime}}$ is normal in $A_{r^\\prime}{B_{r^\\prime}}$,\nwe have\n$$\n[A_{r^\\prime},{B_{r^\\prime}}]\\subseteq[A_{r^\\prime}^{B_{r^\\prime}},\nB_{r^\\prime}^{A_{r^\\prime}}]\\subseteq A_{r^\\prime}^{B_{r^\\prime}}\n\\cap B_{r^\\prime}^{A_{r^\\prime}}=1.\n$$\nHence, $G\\ne N_G(A_{r^\\prime})\\supseteq <A_r,B_{r^\\prime}>$\nand $|G:N_G(A_{r^\\prime})|$ divides $|B_r|$.
