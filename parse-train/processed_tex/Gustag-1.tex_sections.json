The first\nformulation and treatment of this equivalence problem of Lie algebra\nactions on manifolds was done by Sophus Lie in \\cite{Lb}.\nFurther development has focused on the classification around a fixed\npoint of the group action, for instance in the work of Cartan\n\\cite{Car}. For the case of a one-dimensional action with fixed\npoint, also the work of Poincare \\cite{A}  Sternberg\n\\cite{Str}. However the contact case is largely unknown. In\n\\cite{CtG} the normalization of a contact vector field around\na elliptic singularities was treated, moreover in \\cite{Val}\nnormal forms of a Lie algebra actions on general, contact and\nsymplectic manifolds were related to spectral sequences. Thus we\ninitiate the generalization of these results by treating the\nsimplest non-trivial example. However the classification given here will be of particular interest,\n as it has applications to geometric theory of second order differential equations.\nNonetheless the scheme outlined here generalizes naturally to any given Lie algebra structure.\n\nWe begin by recalling some fundamental notions  in contact geometry.\n\n\\subsection{Contact geometry}\nConsider a $2n+1$-dimensional manifold $M$, a contact structure\n$\\xi$ is a $2n$-dimensional distribution  such that the curvature\nform $\\Omega_{\\xi}$ is non-degenerate. Locally we may express any\nco-dimension 1 distribution as the kernel of a differential 1-from\n$\\alpha$ called the contact form $ \\alpha = \\ker\\xi$. We define a\nstrict contact manifold as the pair $(M,\\alpha)$ when $\\xi =\n\\ker\\alpha$ is contact. The non-integrability of the distribution\ncan be expressed through the contact form in by the Forbenious\ncondition $ \\alpha \\wedge (d\\alpha)^n \\neq 0. $\nLet $M$ be a strict contact manifold, then for every $a\\in M$ we\nhave the following decomposition: $ T_aM = \\ker \\alpha_a \\oplus \\ker\nd_a\\alpha, $ where $d_a\\alpha$ defines a symplectic structure on\n$\\xi_a$. A smooth map $\\phi$ between contact manifolds $(M_1,\\xi_1)$\nand $(M_2,\\xi_2)$ is said to be contact if\n$\n\\phi_*(\\xi_1) = \\xi_2.\n$\n Then if $\\phi$ is a diffeomorphism which is also contact, we say that $\\phi$ is a contact diffeomorphism,\n  similarly one defines a contact transformation when $M_1 = M_2$. This condition can equivalently defined for the contact form:\n$ \\phi^* (\\alpha_2) = \\lambda\\alpha_1, $ where $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2$\ncorrespond to $\\xi_1,\\xi_2$ respectively, and $\\lambda\\in\nC^{\\infty}(M_1)$ which we call the conformal factor.\n\n A vector field\n$X\\in \\Gamma(TM)$ is called a contact vector field, when the flow of\n$X$ consists of one-parameter groups of contact transformations.\nThis condition is expressed through the Lie derivative\n $%\\begin{equation}\\label{intro:1}\nL_X(\\alpha) = \\lambda_X \\alpha,$%\\end{equation}\nwhere $L_X$ denotes the Lie derivative along $X$, and $\\lambda_X$ is\nsome smooth function. Equivalently $ L_X(\\alpha) \\wedge \\alpha = 0.\n$ Moreover the pairing $\\alpha(X_f) = f$ defines the generating\nfunction of a  contact vector field.\n This definition is justified by the following proposition:\n\\begin{prop}\nLet $(M,\\alpha)$ be a strict contact manifold. Then for any function $f\\in C^{\\infty}(M)$ there exist a unique contact vector field $X_f$ such that:\n$\n X_f = f,$ $ i_{X_f} d\\alpha = X_1\\alpha - df$, $ L_{X_f} = X_1(f)\\alpha,\n$ where $X_1$ the contact vector field with generating function $1$,\nalso called the Reeb vector field.\nThese properties  define the bijection $ \\Delta:\\;\nC^{\\infty}(M)\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{ct}(M),\\quad f\\rightarrow X_f,\n$\nwhere $\\Delta$ is a linear differential operator and $\\mathfrak{ct}(M)$ is the Lie algebra of contact vector fields.\n\\end{prop}\nThis bijection $\\Delta$ endows $C^{\\infty}(M)$ with a Lie algebra\nstructure by $ \\Delta([f,g]) = [\\Delta(f),\\Delta(g)]. $ This bracket\nis called the Lagrange bracket and  denote it by $\\{f,g\\}$.\n Moreover from the proposition above, we have that\n\\begin{align}\\label{Lagrange}\n\\{f,g\\} = d\\alpha(X_g,X_f) = X_f(g) - X_1(f)g.\n\\end{align}\nThe Darboux theorem states that, two contact manifolds of the same\ndimension are locally contact equivalent.\n\nThis means that locally every contact structure looks like the\nstandard contact structure on $\\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ with coordinates\n$(q_i,u,p_i)$ such that the contact form is given by: $ \\alpha = du\n- \\sum_i p_idq_i. $ In these (canonical) coordinates we have\n%\\begin{align}\\label{eq:ctfield}$$X_f = \\sum_i -f_{p_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_i} + \\left(\\sum_if - p_i f_{p_i} \\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} + \\sum_i\\left(f_{q_i} +p_i f_u \\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i}.\n%\\end{align}\n$$\nThe Reeb vector field in this case has the form\n$\nX_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}.\n$\n It is easy to see that $X_f(a)\\neq 0$ if and only if\n$ f(a)\\neq 0$ or $f(a)=0$, but $df|_{\\xi_a}\\neq 0$.\n\nLet $X_f$ be a vector field such that $X_f(a)\\neq 0$, then we have two possibilities,\n$\n X_f(a)\\in \\xi(a),\n$\nor\n$\n X_f(a)\\not\\in \\xi(a).\n$ Contact diffeomorphisms necessarily preserve this property since\nthey must preserve $\\xi$. Thus defining an invariant property of a\nnon-zero contact vector field. Since the values $f(a)$ determines the direction of $X_f(a)$ transversal to $\\xi_a$,\n we observe that if  $X_f$  is a non-zero contact vector field. Then $X_f(a)\\not\\in\\xi(a)$  if and only if $f(a)\\neq 0$.\n\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a 2-dimensional  Lie algebra over $\\mathbb{R}$\nand let $X_f,X_g$ be a basis in $\\mathfrak{g}$ and $\\rho$ a\nrepresentation of this algebra, into the Lie algebra of contact\nvector fields.\n For simplicity we will denote the images $\\rho(X_f)$ and $\\rho(X_g)$ by $X_f,X_g$ respectively.\n  It is well known that there are two 2-dimensional Lie algebras up to isomorphism, namely the commutative algebra\n%\\begin{align}\\label{commutator2}$[X_f,X_g] = 0,$%\\end{align}\nand the non-commutative algebra\n\\begin{align}\\label{commutator}\n[X_f,X_g] = X_f.\n\\end{align}\nWe will devote our attention to the non-commutative case, as any\nresult in this case will give us an analogous procedure for the\ncommutative algebra.\n\n\nIn the non-commutative case we need to split our investigation into\ntwo cases:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The derived sub-algebra generated by $X_f$ is transversal to the contact distribution at $a\\in M;$\n\\item The derived sub-algebra generated by $X_f$ lies in the contact distribution at $a\\in M.$\n\\end{enumerate}\nThroughout this article we use coordinate charts  centered at $a\\in M$.\n\n\\subsection{Vector fields transversal to the contact distribution}\nWe start by investigating equivalence classes of a contact vector\nfield $X_f$ using the path-lifting method.\n To prove existence of  a contact diffeomorphism $\\phi$ such that\n$\n \\phi_*( X_f)  = X_h,\n$ construct a path $X_{f_t}$ in the space of contact vector fields\nconnecting $X_f$ and $X_h$, such that $X_{f_0} = X_f$ and $X_{f_1} =\nX_h$, or equivalently a path in the space $C^{\\infty}(M)$ connecting\ntheir respective generating functions.\n\n We seek  a one-parameter family of contact diffeomorphisms $\\phi_t$, which fix the point $a$ for all $t$ and is the identity for $t=0$, such that\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:fixesX1}\n\\phi_{t,*}(X_{f_t}) = X_{f_0}.\n\\end{align}\nFor the value $t=1$ we get our desired diffeomorphism.\n\nLet $X_{\\lambda_t}$ to be the one-parameter family of contact vector\nfields corresponding to $\\phi_t$ in the way that $ \\phi^*_{t+\\Delta\nt} = Id + \\Delta tX_{\\lambda_t} + o(\\Delta t). $\n Differentiating \\eqref{eq:fixesX1} we get\n$ \\phi_{t,*}\\left(L_{\\lambda_t}(X_{f_t}) + X_{\\dot{f_t}} \\right)=0,\n$ where $\\dot{f} = \\frac{d}{dt}f_t$. Since $\\phi$ is a\ndiffeomorphism then\n%\\begin{align}\\label{eq:pathPDE}$$\nL_{\\lambda_t}(X_{f_t}) + X_{\\dot{f}} = [X_{\\lambda_t},X_{f_t}] + X_{\\dot{f}} = 0.\n$$%\\end{align}\nThe last condition can be expressed through the Lagrange bracket of the generating functions\n$\n\\{\\lambda_t,f_t\\} + \\dot{f} = 0.\n$\nUsing  \\eqref{Lagrange}, we arrive at the following  PDE for $\\lambda_t$%\\begin{align}\\label{eq:pathPDE}$\nX_{f_t}(\\lambda_t) - X_{1}(f_t)\\lambda_t - \\dot{f_t} = 0.\n$%\\end{align}\n Moreover, since the diffeomorphisms $\\phi_t$ fixes the point we have that $X_{\\lambda_t}(a) = 0$, or\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:restriction}\n\\lambda_{t}(a) = 0,\\hspace{5mm} d_a\\lambda_{t}|_{\\xi_a} =0 .\n\\end{align}\nIt is well known that such a system  has unique solution in a neighborhood of $a$ if the following conditions are satisfied\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The initial data are given on a surface $\\Gamma_t$ which is transversal to $X_{f_t}$ at $a$;\n\\item $X_{f_t}(a)\\neq 0$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n Since $f_t \\neq 0$ the surface $\\Gamma_t$ with $T_a\\Gamma_t = \\xi_a$ will always be transversal to $X_{f_t}(a)$, and the initial condition \\eqref{eq:restriction} will be satisfied if\n$ \\lambda_t|_{\\Gamma_t} = \\lambda^0_{t}, $ where $\\lambda^0_{t} \\in\n\\mu^2_a(\\Gamma)$. Therefore each such $\\lambda^0_{t}$ produces a\nunique solution of \\eqref{eq:pathPDE}, and by constructing a path\n$X_{f_t}$ connecting $X_f$ with $\\pm X_1$ imply solubility.\n Hence we see that every contact vector field $X_f$ is locally equivalent to $\\pm X_1$, however it is\n easy to see that the vector fields $X_1, -X_1$ are locally equivalent by a contact transformation\n mapping  $u$ coordinate to $-u$, summarizing we have the following\n\\begin{thm}\nLet $X$ be a contact vector field on $M$ and $a\\in M$ such that\n$X_a\\not\\in\\xi_a$. Then there are local coordinates\n$(q_1,\\ldots,q_n,u,p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$ in a neighborhood  of $a$ such\nthat $ X= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u}. $\n\\end{thm}\nConsider now the vector field $X_g$ see \\eqref{commutator}, in the\ncoordinates we have picked above.\n The commutator relation\n$ [X_1,X_g] = X_1, $ gives us that $ g = u +\ng_0(q_1,\\ldots,q_n,p_1,\\dots,p_n). $ In order for $X_1,X_g$ to\ndefine a two-dimensional orbit  at $a$ we get in addition the\nfollowing restriction $ dg|_{\\xi_a} \\neq 0. $ To classify such\nfunctions $g$, we apply the path-lifting method once again.\n\n We seek\na contact diffeomorphism $\\phi$ such that\n$\n \\phi_*( X_g)  = X_h,\n$\n and $\\phi$ preserves  $X_f$, that is\n$\n\\phi_*(X_1) = X_1.\n$\nConstruct a path $X_{g_t}$ in the space of contact vector fields  connecting $X_g$ and $X_h$,\nsuch that $X_{g_0} = X_g$ and $X_{g_1} = X_h$ and a one-parameter family of contact diffeomorphisms $\\phi_t$,\n which fixes the point $a$ for all $t$ ,is the identity for $t=0$ and its differential fixes $X_{g_1}$,\n%\\begin{align}$\\phi_{t,*}(X_t) = X_{g_1}.$%\\label{eq:fixesXg1}%\\end{align}\n We choose now $X_{\\lambda_t}$ to be the one-parameter family of\ncontact vector fields corresponding to $\\phi_t$ in the sense that $\n\\phi^*_{t+\\Delta t} = Id + \\Delta tX_{\\lambda_t} + o(\\Delta t). $\nFor $\\phi_t$ to preserve $X_1$ we require additionally that $\nL_{X_{\\lambda_t}}(X_1) = [X_{\\lambda_t}, X_1] = 0. $ From the\nexpression of the  Lagrange bracket, we see that this means that\n$\\lambda_t$ is independent of $u$. As above we arrive at the\nfollowing PDE for $\\lambda_t$:\n\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:pathPDE2}\nX_{g_t}(\\lambda_t) - \\lambda_t - \\dot{g_t} = 0,\\quad\n\\lambda_{t,u} = 0.\n\\end{align}\nWe require that the diffeomorphism $\\phi_t$ fix the point, therefore\nthe vector field $X_{\\lambda_t}$ should satisfy $X_{\\lambda_t}(0) =\n0$.\n This condition can be expressed through the generating function $\\lambda_t$ as\n%\\begin{align}\\label{eq:restriction2}$\\lambda_{t}(a) = d\\lambda_{t}|_{\\xi_a} = 0.$%\\end{align}\n Since $\\lambda_t$ is independent of $u$, and we have that $d_0\\lambda_t = 0$. From this and  \\eqref{eq:pathPDE2} we see that $\\dot{g}_t = 0$.\n\nConsider the projection $ \\pi : M \\rightarrow \\overline{M}, $ where\n$\\overline{M}$ is the quotient of $M$ by the action of $X_1$;\n\\eqref{eq:pathPDE2} takes the form\n$\n\\overline{X}_{g_t}(\\lambda_t) = \\lambda_t + \\dot{g_t},\n$\nwhere\n$\n\\overline{X}_{g_t} = \\pi_{*}(X_{g_t}).\n$\n Let $\\Gamma_t$ be any $2n-1$-dimensional hyper-surface in $\\overline{M}$  passing though $a$, such that $\\Gamma_t$ is transversal to $\\overline{X}_{g_t}$ at $a$. Then the initial condition\n$\n\\lambda_t|_{\\Gamma} = \\lambda^0_{t}\n$% where $\\lambda^0_{t} \\in\\mu^2_a(\\Gamma_t)$, gives us \\eqref{eq:restrictions2}\\\\%Again this function is free for us to choose, and each choice gives a unique solution $\\lambda_t$.\\\\%Let $g_t$ be a non-zero path in $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{2n})$ connecting $g_0$ and $p_1$% Thus every vector field in each component of the half planes defined by $\\Gamma$ are locally equivalent. However it is easy to see that there exists a contact transformation mapping these to one another.\\\\\nThus we have  coordinates $(q_1,\\ldots,q_n,u,p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$ such that\n$\nX_g = c X_1 + X_{p_1+u},\n$\nwhere $c\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n%However this arbitrary constant comes from the choice of basis of our Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.  More specifically if%\\begin{displaymath}%[X_f,X_g] = [X_f, X_{\\overline{g}}+cX_f],%\\end{displaymath}%we can choose basis $X_f,X_{\\overline{g}}$.\\\\\nSummarizing we have shown the following\n\\begin{thm}\nLet $\\rho_1,\\rho_2$ be contact  representations of the non-Abelian\nLie algebra of the dimension 2 with two-dimensional orbit,\n such that  the representations of their derived\n sub-algebras do not belong to the contact distribution at $a\\in M$. Then $\\rho_1,\\rho_2$ are locally contact equivalent.\n\\end{thm}\nThe following corollary follows immediately.\n\\begin{coro}\nLet $\\rho$ be a contact representation of the non-commutative\nLie algebra satisfying the conditions above,\nthen there exists a basis $X_f,X_g$ of $\\mathfrak{g}$\nand a local canonical coordinates $(q_1\\ldots,q_n,u,p_1,\\ldots,p_n)$ in a neighborhood of $a$ such that\n$$\nX_f  = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u},\\quad X_g  =\n-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q_1} + u \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} +\n\\sum_{i=1}^np_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_i}.\n$$\n\\end{coro}\nThe commutative case will be completely analogous, and we arrive at the following\n\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{commutative}\nLet $\\rho_1,\\rho_2$ be contact representations of the commutative\nLie algebra of  dimension 2 with two-dimensional orbit, such that\nthe image of $\\rho_1,\\rho_2$ do not belong  to the contact\ndistribution at $a$.

We apply the path-lifting method and arrive at the equation:%\\begin{align}\\label{eq:pathPDEirr}%X_{f_t}(\\lambda_t) = X_{1}(f_t)\\lambda_t + \\dot{f_t},\\\\%\\lambda_t(0) = \\lambda_{t,p}(0) = \\lambda_{t,q}(0) = 0.%\\end{align}%As in the case when $f(a)\\neq 0$ we get well posed initial values when $\\dot{f_t}(0) = 0$.%Therefore we construct the path%\\begin{displaymath}%f_t = (t-1)f + t f_{lin},%\\end{displaymath}%where $f_{lin}$ is the linear term in $p,q$.%Putting this path int \\eqref{eq:pathPDEirr} we have that  $X_{f_t}(0)\\neq 0$. Thus every contact vector field of this type is determined by its linear terms in $p,q$. It is easy to see that we can pick a symplectic transformation which maps this vector field to a vector field with generating function $p$.% Thus we have shown the following%\\begin{lemma}%Let $X_f$ be a contact vector field, with a one-dimensional orbit at a  point $a\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $f(a)=0$. Then there are local coordinates $(q,u,p)$ in a neighbourhood of $a$ such that%\\begin{displaymath}%X_f = X_p = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}.%\\end{displaymath}%\\end{lemma}%Consider now the vector field $X_g$, in the coordinates we have picked above, then the commutator relation%\\begin{displaymath}%[X_p,X_g] = X_p,%\\end{displaymath}%gives us that%\\begin{displaymath}%g = -qp + g_0(u,p).%\\end{displaymath}%Since we assume that $X_g$ is irregular, we have that $g_0(0)= 0$ in these coordinates. Therefore in order for $X_g$ to be transitive we have that $g_p(0)\\neq 0$. However we see that $X_p(0) = k X_g(0)$ for some $k\\neq 0$. Thus our action is one dimensional. This follows from the bracket genereating property of the contact distribution. This however only occurs in dimension three. More generally in $2n+1$ dimensional contact space  given  $n+1$ irregular contact vector fields $X_1,\\ldots,X_{n+1}$ where $X_{i}(0) \\not\\in \\spn\\{X_1,\\ldots,X_{n+1} \\}$, then there is $i\\neq j$ such that%\\begin{displaymath}%[X_i, X_j] = X_{\\gamma},%\\end{displaymath}%where $X_{\\gamma}$ is a regular vector field.",

Since $\\xi$ is non-integrable, we have that  $[\\xi,\\xi]\\not\\in \\xi$. Thus $X_f,X_g$ cannot define a two-dimensional orbit.\n\n\n\nAssume that $n \\geq 2$, since $\\lambda_t$ is independent of $q_1$ we can consider \\eqref{eq:pathPDE4} as an equation in dimension $2n$. That is consider the projection\n$\n\\pi: M \\rightarrow \\overline{M},\n$\nwhere $\\overline{M}$ denotes the quotient of $M$ by the action of $X_f$. On $\\overline{M}$ we have\n\\begin{align}\\label{dritt1}\n\\overline{X}_{g_t}(\\lambda_t) = X_1(g_t)\\lambda_t + \\dot{g},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $ \\overline{X}_{g_t} = \\pi_{*}(X_{g_t}). $ and $\\pi$ denotes\nthe projection onto the orthogonal compliment of $X_f(a)$.\n On this space we have from \\eqref{dritt1} that\n%\\begin{align}\\label{eq:dritt}$\\dot{g}(a) = 0.$%\\end{align}\n Let  $\\Gamma_t$ be a hyper-surface in $\\overline{M}$ such that $T_a\\Gamma_t$ is transversal to $X_{g_t}(a)$.\nThen we impose the initial conditions restricted to $\\Gamma_t$$\n\\lambda_t|_{\\Gamma} = \\lambda^0_t,\n$\nwhere $\\lambda^0_{t}$ satisfies the initial data.\nConstruct again a hyper-surface $\\Gamma_t$  and non-zero a path connecting $X_{g_0}$ with $X_{p_2}$.

            "\nIn this section, we find the second order differential invariants of the normal forms found in  the previous sections, thus finding contact equivalences of second order differential equations solvable by quadratures. For a complete exposition on this method, we refer the reader to ~\\cite{CtG}. \\\\%Let $M=J^1(\\mathbb{R})$ be the set of 1-jets of mappings from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, and let $\\pi$ denote the natural projection $\\pi : J^1(\\mathbb{R})\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$. We will fix coordinates $(x,y,y_1)$ on $M$ such that the 1-jet of the mapping $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ has the the fixed point $x_0$ the coordinates $(x_0,f(x_0),f'(x_0))$\\\\%Using this one constructs a natural contact structure on $M$. Define the distribution $\\xi\\subset TM$ as the plane with the property that the flow of which is precisely the curves of the form $(p,f(p),f'(p))$, where $f$ is some smooth function defined on an interval. \\\\%Given a local transformation $\\phi$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, then there exists a unique local contact transformation $\\phi^{(1)}: J^1(\\mathbb{R})\\rightarrow J^1(\\mathbb{R})$ such that the following diagram commutes%\\begin{center}%\\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2.5cm, auto]%  \\node (J1) {$J^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$};%  \\node (J0) [below of=J1] {$\\mathbb{R}^2$};%  \\node (J11) [right of=J1] {$J^1(\\mathbb{R}^2)$};%  \\node (J01) [below of=J11] {$\\mathbb{R}^2$};%  \\draw[->] (J0) to node {$\\phi$} (J01);% \\draw[->] (J1) to node {$\\pi$} (J0);% \\draw[->] (J11) to node {$\\pi$} (J01);% \\draw[->, dashed] (J1) to node {$\\phi^{(1)}$} (J11);%\\end{tikzpicture}%\\end{center}%The transformation $\\phi^{(1)}$ is called the first prolongation of $\\phi$, in addition one defines the first prolongation of a vector field $X^{(1)}$ on $J^1(\\mathbb{R})$ such that $\\phi_*(X^{(1)}) = X$. In a simlar way one defines higher order prolongations.\\\\%The following theorem is classical (see for reference ~\\cite{krasil})%\\begin{thm}%Any vector field $X$ of the jet manifold $J^k(\\mathbb{R}), k\\geq 1$ is given as:%\\begin{enumerate}%\\item The prolongation of a contact vector field on the space $J^1(\\mathbb{R})$.%\\item The prolongation of an arbitrary vector field on the space $J^0(\\mathbb{R})$.%\\end{enumerate}%\\end{thm}%Consider now a second order differential equation $\\mathcal{E}$ as a subspace of $J^2(\\mathbb{R})$. A transformation $\\phi: J^2(\\mathbb{R})\\rightarrow J^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is said to be a symmetry of $\\mathcal{E}$ if $\\phi(\\mathcal{E}) = \\mathcal{E}$, moreover an infinitesimal symmetry is a map $\\phi$ such that $T\\phi = T\\mathcal{E}$. Thus we see that a differential equation $\\mathcal{E}$ has $\\mathfrak{g}$ as a symmetry algebra if%\\begin{displaymath}%X_i(\\mathcal{E}) = \\lambda \\mathcal{E},%\\end{displaymath}%for every $i$, where $X_i$ are the generators of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\\\\% In the case of $\\lambda=0$ we say that $\\mathcal{E}$ is a basic invariant of $\\mathcal{g}$, moreover the Lie-Bianchi theorem states that if the $n$ dimensional symmetry algebra is solvable, then the $n-$th order ordinary differential equation is solvable by quadratures. Since the two dimensional Lie algebras are all solvable, we provide a list their basic invariants and their quadrature.\\\\\\begin{table}[h!]\n\\caption{Differential invariants}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ & $X$ & $Y$ &$n$-th  order invariant & $n$-th order\nODE\\\\ \\hline\n\n$[X,Y] = 0$     &\n $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ &\n $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ &\n$I_n = y_n$ &\n $F(I_1,\\ldots,I_n)= 0$ \\\\\n\n$[X,Y] = X$ &\n $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ &\n $-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + y\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + y_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1}$ &\n$I_n = y_ne^x$ &\n$F(I_1,\\ldots,I_n) = 0$\\\\\n\n$[X,Y] = X$ &\n $ -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ &\n $x\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + (y+1)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} - y_1\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_1}$  &\n$I_n=\\frac{y_n}{y+1}$ &\n$F(I_1,\\ldots,I_n) = 0$\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"
