Sharon and D. Mumford suggested an approach for analysis of $2$-dimensional shapes by the conformal group.\nNamely, they study plane domains with smooth boundaries up to conformal equivalence.\nDomains in their approach are assumed to be empty, i. e. they do not carry any geometrical structure except the conformal one.\n\nIn this paper we extend their approach to analyze $2$-dimensional domains equipped with a some geometrical object.\nWe study in details  cases when domains are considered together with functions, differential $1$-forms or foliations on its and two such \"decorated\" domains are equivalent if there is a conformal mapping of them which equalizes the corresponding geometrical objects.\n\nFirst of all we remark that the Riemann conformal mapping theorem transforms the problem to study equivalence of functions, differential $1$-forms or foliations on the Lobachevsky plane with respect to the group of M\\\"{o}bius transformations.\n\nSecondly, application of Lie--Tresse theorem\n\\cite{kl13}\nallows us to find fields of rational differential invariants for the different actions of the group $PSL_{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ of the M\\\"{o}bius transformations.\nThese fields separate regular orbits of actions of the M\\\"{o}bius transformations on the jet-spaces of functions, differential $1$-forms and foliations respectively and give complete solutions of the equivalence problem for regular cases.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%",
