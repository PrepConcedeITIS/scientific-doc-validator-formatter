        "doco:conclusion": "%\\begin{center}%\\textbf{Conclusion}%\\end{center}\nIn the present paper, we suggest an approach to constructing\nasymmetric encryption systems based on bilinear pairings on groups.\nA computationally hard problem in these systems is the discrete\nlogarithm problem, which can be seen from the description of  the\nciphering and deciphering in the systems presented in the preceding\nsection. Let $r$ be a given ciphertext obtained by encryption of a\ntext $M$ in the system  1) or 2), $ r = a^M \\mod{m^2} $ or $ r =\na^M \\mod{N^m}. $ Then an attack of the first type against these\nsystems is a search for a solution of the discrete logarithm\nproblem, $ M = \\log_ar. $ Consequently, we have reasons to believe\nthat choosing groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ for which there is a pairing\nsuch that  there are no effective algorithms in $G_2$ for finding\nthe discrete logarithm, we obtain cryptosystems with more effective\nkey sizes than RSA or ElGamal. A search for such groups is of\nconsiderable interest for cryptography. A more serious\ncryptoanalysis also needed because the  proposed cryptosystem is\nbased on the Wieferich numbers not previously used in cryptography.\nSubsequently, it will be required to search for specific attacks\nagainst these systems, which could either simplify the solution of\nthe discrete logarithm problem or to verify their absence.\n\nThe authors are grateful to Nikolai Osipov (Institute of Space and\nInformation Technologies of the Siberian Federal University\n(Krasnoyarsk)) for their interest and valuable comments.\n\n",

            "%\\begin{center}%\\textbf{\\textsection 1. Pairings}%\\end{center}$1^0.$ Pairings in number fields considered in the present paper\nfirst appeared when David Hilbert began to develop Kronecker's idea\nconcerning an analogy between numbers and functions (for more\ndetails about this analogy, see the book [1]).\n\nHilbert applied this idea to a long-standing problem on the\nreciprocity law, which consisted in finding an explicit expression\nfor the product of $n$th power residue symbols in a number field\ncontaining all $n$th roots of  1,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)_n \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right)_n^{-1} = \\zeta_n^{f(\\alpha, \\beta)},\n$$\ni.e., in the calculation of the function $f(\\alpha, \\beta) \\in\n\\mathbb{Z} \\mod n\\mathbb{Z}$(for details, see, e.g., [2]). In his\n9th problem, D. Hilbert suggested to extend the calculations from\nnumber fields to the fields of $p$-adic numbers, i.e. from global\nfields to local fields in the terminology of  Serre. In other words,\nto make these calculations local,  which in essense is an analog of\nthe calculation of the Abelian integral of a differential form on a\nRiemann surface in terms of residues (see [3], p. 114)).\n\nAn analog of the residue of a differential form in a local field is\nthe norm residue symbol defined by Hilbert (the Hilbert symbol)\n$\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\\beta}{\\rho}\\right)_n$ defined in a $p$-adic\n(local) field containing all $n$th roots of 1. The definition of\nHilbert's symbol can be found in many sources (see, e.g., [4]).\nClass field theory connects the product of power residues with the\nproduct of local symbols (see Hasse [2]):\n$\n\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)_n\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right)^{-1}_n\n= \\prod\\limits_{\\rho|n\\infty}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha,\n\\beta}{\\rho}\\right)_n.\n$\nWe will present an explicit formula for the norm residue symbol\nfirst obtained in the papers [4] -- [6]; this formula shows\nmore clearly an analogy between this symbol and the residue of a\ndifferential form at a singular point.\n\nLet $K$ be a local field (a finite extesion of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$)\ncontaining a primitive $p^n$th root $\\zeta$ of $1$. Let $\\pi$ be a\nprime element of $K$, let $\\mathfrak{o}$ be the ring of integers of\nthe inertia subfield $T$ of the extesion $K/\\mathbb{Q}_p$, and let\n$\\tr:=\\tr_{T/\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ be the trace operator. For an element\n$\\alpha \\not= 0$, we denote by\n$\\underline{\\alpha}:=\\underline{\\alpha}(x)$ an arbitrary series in\n$\\mathfrak{o}((x))^*$ such that $\\underline{\\alpha}(\\pi) = \\alpha$.\nLet $\\Delta $ be the Frobenius automorphism in\n$\\mathfrak{o}/\\mathbb{Z}_p$; by the same letter, we denote the\nFrobenius operator on the Loran series ring $\\mathfrak{o}((x)),$$\nf(x)^{\\Delta} = (\\Sigma a_ix^i)^{\\Delta} = \\Sigma a^{\\Delta}_ix^{pi}\n$ We define a function $l$ on the group $\\mathfrak{o}((x))^*$ of\ninvertible series with values in the additive group of the power\nseries ring $\\mathfrak{o}[[x]]$, $ l:\\mathfrak{o}((x))^*\n\\longrightarrow \\mathfrak{o}[[x]], $ as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nl(f) = \\frac{1}{p}\\log f^p/f^{\\Delta}, f \\in \\mathfrak{o}((x))^*\n\\end{equation}(see [4], \\textsection 1). For arbitrary elements $\\alpha,  \\beta\\in\nK^*$ and the corresponding series $\\underline{\\alpha},\n\\underline{\\beta}\\in \\mathfrak{o}((x))^*$, we consider the series\n%\\begin{equation}$\n\\Phi(\\alpha, \\beta) = l(\\underline{\\alpha})dl(\\underline{\\beta})  -\nl(\\underline{\\alpha})\\underline{\\beta}^{-1}d\\underline{\\beta} +\nl(\\underline{\\beta})\\underline{\\alpha}^{-1}d\\underline{\\alpha},\n%\\end{equation}\n$\nwhere $d:=\\frac{d}{dx}$(see [4], \\textsection 2). Then, for\n$p\\not=2$, we obtain the following explicit formula for the Hilbert\nsymbol:\n\\begin{equation}\n(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\zeta^{\\tr \\res_x\\Phi(\\alpha, \\beta)/s(x)},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $s(x)=(\\underline{\\zeta}^{p^n}-1)^{-1}$ if the first coefficients of\n $\\underline{\\alpha}$ and  $ \\underline{\\beta}$ belong to the Teichm\\\"{u}ller\n system $\\mathcal{R}$ and  $s(x) = (\\underline{\\zeta}^{p^n}-1)^{-1} + 1/2$ in the general case (see [7], \\textsection 6).\n\n{\\bf Remark}. The    series $\\Phi(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is an analog of a\ndifferential form. Therefore, the norm residue symbol ( , ) is an\nanalog of the residue of the differential form $\\Phi(\\alpha, \\beta)$\nat the ``singular point'' $\\underline{\\zeta}^{p^n}-1$ since\n$\\zeta^{p^n} - 1 = 0$.\n\nFormula (2) can be obtain in two essentially different ways; both\nrely on unramified extensions as the core of class field theory. In\nthe case of Kummer extensions, where the $n$th roots of 1 belong to\nthe ground field, the unramified extensions are given by the\nso-called primary elements.We recall that an element $\\omega$ of a\nlocal field $K$ containing all $n$th roots of $1$ is called\n$n$-primary (or primary) if the extension $K(\\sqrt[n]{\\omega})/K$ is\nunramified. Thus, to derive formula (2), we must calculate the\n$p^n$-primary elements in $K$ explicitly. An arbitrary primary\nelement was first calculated in the paper [4], $\\textsection 4$; it\nhas the form $ \\omega(a) = E(a(\\underline{\\zeta}^{p^n}-1))|_{x =\n\\pi},~~~~~~~~ a \\in \\mathfrak{o}, $ and, for the Hilbert symbol, we\nhave the equation\n%\\begin{equation}$\n(\\pi, \\omega(a)) = \\zeta^{\\tr a},\n$%\\end{equation}\nvalid for an arbitrary prime element $\\pi$.\n\nThe first method of deriving formula (2) is as follows. First, using\nthe Eisenstein relation $(x, x-1) = 1$, $x\\not=0,1$(in $K$-theory\nthis relation is called the Steiberg relation), we reduce the\ncalculation of $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ for arbitrary elements $\\alpha,\n\\beta\\in K^*$ to the calculation of $(\\pi, \\varepsilon)$, where\n$\\varepsilon $ is a principal unit in $K$. Now, knowing all primary\nelements explicitly and using the decomposition of $\\varepsilon$\ninto the product $ \\varepsilon =  \\prod\\limits_{\\theta, p \\nmid\ni}(1-\\theta \\pi^i)^{a_{\\theta, i}}\\omega(a_{\\varepsilon}), ~~~\na_{\\theta, i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p, $ where $\\theta$ runs over the\nTeichm\\\"{u}ller system $\\mathcal{R}$, we calculate the symbol $(\\pi,\n\\varepsilon)$. Here we again take into account the Eisenstein\nrelation, which implies the relation $(\\pi, 1 - \\theta \\pi^i) = 1$\nfor $(i, p) = 1$. Hence, by (3), we obtain $ (\\pi, \\varepsilon) =\n\\zeta^{\\tr a_{\\varepsilon}} $.  For details, see [4], [8],  and\nsections  1 and 2 in [9].\n\nThe second way of deriving formula (2) is based on the explicit\nconstruction of the pairing\n%\\begin{equation}$\n< , >: K^*\\times K^* \\longrightarrow \\mu_{p^n}\n%\\end{equation}\n$ given by (2).\n\n We must check that the pairing is well defined, i.e.,\nthat the following properties are valid: the invariance under the\nchoice of a prime element and the independence of an expansions of\nthe elements of $K^*$ in powers of the prime. Next we must check the\nbasic property of the pairing, i.e.,\n$$\n<\\alpha, \\beta> = 1 \\Leftrightarrow \\alpha \\; \\text{is a norm in the extension}\\; K\\left(\\sqrt[p^n]{\\beta}\\right),\n$$\nand, finally, we must check that the pairing $< , >$ coincides with\nthe Hilbert symbol.\n\nThis plan was implemented in the paper [4]. The second way is more\ninteresting because the pairing $< , >$ can be used to explicitly\nconstruct\n class field theory for Kummer extensions, which is an analog of the theory of vector spaces with scalar product.\n This one more time emphasizes the idea of a deep analogy between numbers and functions.  The result is as follows ([4],  \\S 7).\n\nLet $A  $ be a subgroup of finite index in $K^{*}$ containing\n$K^{*p^n}$  and let $B = A^{\\perp}$ be the orthogonal complement of\n$A$ with respect to the scalar product $< , >$. Then $B$ is the\ngroup of norms of the extension $K(\\sqrt[p^n]{A})/K,$$Nm_{L/K}L^* = B$,  where $L = K(\\sqrt[p^n]{A}).$\n An approach to the derivation of explicit formulas based on the field of norms is suggested in [10].\n\n$2^0.$ In the late 70th, K. Kato and A. Parshin motivated by the\nneeds of algebraic geometry constructed the theory of\nmultidimensional complete fields based on $K$-theory (see [11] --\n[13]).\n\nWe give the definition of a multidimensional complete field. Let $K$\nbe a complete discrete valuation field with a perfect residue field\n$ k$ of characteristic  $p>0$. We call such a field a\none-dimensional complete field and its residue field $k$ a\nzero-dimensional complete field.\n\n\\begin{defenition}   A field $K$ is called an  $n$-dimensional\ncomplete field if $K$ is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and the residue field $\\overline{K}$ of $K$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional complete field.\n\\end{defenition}\nPutting $K=K_n$ and $\\overline{K}=K_{n-1}$, we obtain the sequence\nof fields\n$\nk=K_0, K_1, \\dots, K_{n-1}, K_n=K\n$\nin which $K_{i-1}$ is the residue field of the complete discrete valuation field $K_i, i \\geq 1$.\n\\begin{defenition}\nWe say that a complete $n$-dimensional field $K$ is\nequal-characteristic if $\\cha~K = \\cha k$, is\ndistinct-characteristic if $\\cha K=0, \\cha K_{n-1}=p>0$, and is\nmixed-characteristic if $\\cha K=\\dots=\\cha K_s=0$, $\\cha\nK_{s-1}=p>0, s\\geq 1.$\n\\end{defenition}\nThe Loran series field $\\mathbb{F}_p((u))((t))$ gives an example of\nan equal-characteristic field. The Loran series field\n$\\mathbb{Q}_p((t))$ is a mixed-characteristic two-dimensional field.\nThe field of infinite in both directions Loran series $ K =\n\\mathbb{Q}_p\\{\\{t\\}\\} = {\\sum\\limits_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty}a_it^i, a_i\n\\in \\mathbb{Q}_p}, $ where $a_i \\to 0~ \\text{as}~ i \\to -\\infty$ and\nthe set of coefficients is bounded from below in the norm of the\nfield $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, gives an example of a distinct-characteristic\ntwo-dimensional field since $\\cha K = 0,~ \\cha \\overline{K}=p$,\nwhere $\\overline{K} = \\mathbb{F}_p((t)).$\nThe definition of the Hilbert symbol in the multidimensional field\nis based on the reciprocity map. In the case of a\ndistinct-characteristic multidimensional field $K$, we define the\nreciprocity map as follows:\n$\n\\psi: K_n^{top}(K) \\to Gal(K^{ab}/K),\n$\nwhere $K_n^{top}$ is Milnor's topological $K$-group equipped with the Parshin topology (see [13]). We assume that the field $K$ contains the group $\\mu_m$ of $m$th roots of 1. Then the Hilbert symbol is defined as follows:\n$$\n(~,~): K_n^{top}(K)\\times K^* \\to \\mu_m, \\quad  (\\{\\alpha_1, \\dots,\n\\alpha_n\\}, \\beta)=\\sqrt[m]{\\beta}^{\\psi(\\{\\alpha_1, \\dots,\n\\alpha_n\\})-1}.\n$$\nIn an arbitrary complete multidimensional field, the definition is\nmore involved. For details, see the paper [14].\n\nIn a distinct-characteristic multidimensional local field with\nfinite last residue field,  an explicit formula for the Hilbert\nsymbol and constructive class field theory is obtained in the paper\n[15]. For the general complete multidimensional field the result is\nobtained in the papers  [16] and [17](see also [18] and [19]).\n\n$3^0.$ Now, we turn to the generalization of the reciprocity law to\nthe formal modules. This generalization is motivated by the needs of\nalgebraic geometry and is used, for example, in the theory of\nelliptic curves. The formal group laws first were defined by Bochner\nin 1946 in connection with the theory of real and complex of Lie\ngroups, for which the group operation in the vicinity of 1 is\ndefined by a tuple  of convergent power series satisfting certain\nrelations following from the group axioms. Bochner suggested to\nregard such a tuple per se regardless the convergence. The Lie\nalgebra of the given Lie group is determined by this tuple of formal\nseries. In this way we obtain  new objects intermediate between Lie\ngroups and Lie algebras and called formal group laws. Formal group\nlaws arise in many other situations; e.g., an arbitrary Dirichlet\nseries\n$\nL(s, \\chi) = \\sum\\limits_{n \\geq 1} \\chi(n)n^{-s},\n$\nwhere $\\chi$ is the Dirichlet character modulo $n$ admitting the Euler expansion gives rise to\n a one-dimensional formal group law. Such formal group laws arise naturally in the complex oriented cohomology theory.\n The addition of points on an elliptic curve is defined by a regular function, and in terms of a local parameter in a\n  neighborhood of zero the addition is given by a formal series in two variables satisfying natural conditions following\n   from group identities. Thus, an elliptic curve yields a formal group law.\n\n\\begin{defenition}\nA one-dimensional formal group law (or, simply, a one-dimensional\nformal group) over a ring $R$ is a series $F(X, Y) \\in R[[X, Y]] $\nsatisfying the conditions 1. $F(X, F(Y, Z)) = F(F(X, Y), Z) $\n(associativity); 2. $F(X, 0) = X$, $ F(0, Y)=X$ (for details, see\n[20]).\n\\end{defenition}\nWe have the following important classes of formal groups: 1. The\nLubin--Tate formal groups; 2. The relative Lubin--Tate formal\ngroups; 3. The Honda formal groups; 4. The polynomial formal groups.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of the first three types of formal groups\nis that the endomorphism ring of the formal group is isomorphic\neither to the ring over which the formal group is defined (the\nLubin--Tate formal groups) or is an unramified subextension of this\nring. The polynomial formal groups have the form $X+Y+aXY$;  they\nare the only formal group laws given by polynomials and have the\nproperty that the ring over which the group is defined (i.e., a ring\ncontaining the element $a$) can be an arbitrary extension of the\nendomorphism ring isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nThe Lubin--Tate formal groups  first arised   in the  paper $[21]$\nfor an explicit construction of Abelian extensions (see [22]) in\nlocal class field theory. The relative Lubin--Tate formal groups\nwere applied to the study of metabelian $p$-extensions of local\nfields (see [23]). The Honda formal groups are important primarily\nbecause they give all formal groups over the ring of Witt vectors\n(see [24]). The polynomial formal groups are used, in particular, in\nthe study of quadratic extensions of number fields (for details, see\n[24]).\n\nWe define the Hilbert pairing on formal modules in a local field.\nLet $\u041a$ be a local field, and let $F(X, Y)$ be a formal group\ndefined over the ring of integers of $K$. Let $\\mathfrak{o}$ be the\nendomorphism ring and  $\\pi$ be a prime element of $\\mathfrak{o}$.\n\n\nWe consider an extension $L$ of $K$ containing the kernel of the\nisogeny $[\\pi^n]_F$, $\\Ker[\\pi^n]_F\\subset L$. Let $\\mathfrak{M}$ be\nthe maximal ideal in  $L$. We define the structure of a formal\nmodule on  $\\mathfrak{M}$ by putting $ \\alpha + _F\\beta = F(\\alpha,\n\\beta)~ \\text{for}~ \\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathfrak{M},\n$\nand denote the module obtained by $F(\\mathfrak{M})$. It is clear that  $\\Ker[\\pi^n]_F \\subset F(\\mathfrak{M})$. Let, as before,\n$\n\\psi: L^* \\longrightarrow Gal(L^{ab}/L)\n$\nbe the reciprocity map of  $L$. Then the Hilbert symbol is defined as follows:\n$$\n(~,~)_{F, n}: L^* \\times F(\\mathfrak{M}) \\longrightarrow\n\\Ker[\\pi^n]_F,\n%$$\n%$$\n\\quad (\\alpha, \\beta)_{F, n} =\n\\left(\\frac{1}{[\\pi^n]_F}(\\beta)\\right)^{\\psi} -\n_F\\left(\\frac{1}{[\\pi^n]_F}(\\beta)\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{[\\pi^n]_F}(\\beta) $ is a root of the\nequation $[\\pi^n]_F(X)=\\beta$ in the algebraic closure.\n\nThe first explicit formulas were obtained for the Lubin --Tate\nformal groups (see [25], [26]). For the Lubin--Tate relative formal\ngroups, explicit formulas were obtained in [27] and, for the Honda\nformal groups,\n in [28] -- [32]. Explicit formulas for the polynomial formal groups were obtained in  [33] in the unramified case and in  [34] in the general case.\n\n$4^0.$ For the methods of cryptography considered in part 2 of the\npresent paper, we use a very particular case of the multiplicative\npairing (2) in the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}_p(\\xi)$, where $\\xi$\nis a primitive $p$th root of 1; namely, we use the pairing $ <~,~>:\n<\\pi> \\times \\mathbb{Z}_p^* \\to \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, $ <\\pi, a>\n= \\res_Xx^{-1}l(a)(x^{_p}+ \\frac{1}{2}),\n$\nwhere the function $l$ is defined in (1). For applications in cryptography it is convenient to define this pairing in the form\n$$\n<~,~>: \\mathbb{Z}^{(p)} \\times \\mathbb N^+\\to\n\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}, \\quad  <n, a> = l(n)a \\pmod p\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{Z}^{(p)}$ is the monoid of positive integers prime to $p$.\n\n",
            "%\\begin{center}%\\textbf{\\textsection 2. A cryptography system}%\\end{center}$1^0.$ In 1975   a public-key cryptography was invented. As a\nresult, all asymmetric encryption systems appeared later were based\non a certain hard-to-calculate problem. Every such a system led to a\nthorough investigation of the problem providing its security.   The\nRSA  [39]  motivated the study of integer  factorization, and the\nDiffie--Hellman protocols  and ElGamal cryptosystems  [37]  drew\nattention to the discrete logarithm problem. This led to the\nalgorithms such as the Pollard $\\rho$- and $\\chi$-methods, the\ngeneral sieve method for a number field, etc., which deepened our\nunderstanding of these problems and made it possible to solve them\nconsiderably faster than the authors of these systems anticipated.\nHowever, it is not known whether the discrete logarithm or the\nfactorization problem belongs to the class of $NP$-complete\nproblems, i.e., the problems which are considered to be\ncomputationally hard. Moreover, for these problems, there are\nalgorithms running in polynomial time on quantum computers. All this\nmotivates a further search for new computationally hard problems,\nwhich could be used for constructing encryption systems.\n\nTo construct a pairing-based encryption system in the general case,\nwe need two groups and an encryption map sending a pair of elements\nof one group to an element in the other group. The elements of the\nfirst group are messages,   the elements of the second group are\nencrypted texts, and the closed key is the inverse map.\n\nWe describe this method formally.\n Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be given groups of a prime order $q$, and let\n$\ne:G_1 \\times G_1 \\longrightarrow G_2\n$\nbe a given map.\nWe denote the elements of  $G_1$ by capitals $P$ and $ Q$ and assume that  $aP = \\underbrace{P + P + \\dots + P}_{a}$. Then\nthe maps that can be used effectively for constructing cryptosystems have the following properties:\n%\\begin{itemize}\n1. Bilinearity: $ \\forall P, Q \\in G_1~~~ \\forall a, b \\in \\mathbb\nN^+\\qquad e(aP, bQ) = e(P, Q)^{ab}.\n$\n2. Nondegeneracy: $ P \\not= 0 \\Rightarrow e(P, P) \\not= 1.\n$\n3. Computability: there must exist an effective algorithm for\ncomputing $e$.\n%\\end{itemize}\nThere are two well-known examples of maps satisfying these properties, namely, the pairings of Weil and Tate.\n The cryptosystems mentioned above are based on these pairings. The problem that a malefactor have to solve to break the encryption is obviously the discrete logarithm problem,\n  i.e.,  for given $P$ and $Q$  find $a$ such that $Q = aP$.  For a special choice of the groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, it may happen that there are no known algorithms for this problem better than the complete sorting.\n   It is clear that it is not harder to solve the discrete logarithm problem in $G_1$ than in $G_2$. Let $e(P, Q) = e(P, aP) = e(P, P)^a$. Then $P' = e(P, P)$ and $ Q' = e(P, Q)$, and $a$ can be found in the group\n   $G_2$ as $\\log_{P'}(Q')$. The Diffie--Hellman problem  (Decisional Diffie--Hellman or DDH) in a group is computationally easy. The DDH problem consists in distinguishing two tuples $<P, aP, bP, C=cP>$ and $<P, aP, bP, C=abP>$ for unknown $a$ and $b$. Indeed, if   calculating $v_1 = <aP, bP>$ and $v_2=<P, C>$, we obtain that $v_1=v_2$, then the given tuple belongs to the type\n $$\n <P, aP, bP, abP>: e(aP, bP)=e(P, P)^{ab}=e(P, abP)=e(P, C).\n $$ Thus, if the mapping $e$ is known, then the solution of the  DDH problem needs less complexity.\n\n \\subsection{Pairings and  Wieferich numbers}% \\begin{center}%\\textbf{Pairings and  Wieferich numbers}%\\end{center}\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[*] $p $ is an odd  prime;\n\\item[*] $\\mathbb{N}^+$ is the additive semigroup of positive integers;\n\\item[*] $\\mathbb{Z}^{(p)} = \\mathbb{Z}^*_{(p)} \\cap \\mathbb{Z}$ is the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers prime to $p$  (here $\\mathbb{Z}^*_{(p)}$ is the group of invertible elements of the ring of  rational $p$-integers);\n\\item[*] $l(a) = \\frac{1}{p}\\log a^{p-1}, a \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{(p)}$ is the function inverse to the Artin--Hasse function.

We choose an  $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying the\nfollowing condition: $ \\frac{a^{p-1}-1}{p} \\not\\equiv  0 \\mod p $\nand  then find a solution $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$ to the congruence $\n\\frac{a^{p-1}-1}{p}n \\equiv 1 \\mod p. $ From that it follows by\nLemma 2 equality (4).\nWe  take the triple $(q, p, n)$ as a\nclosed key and the pair $(a, m)$ as an open key.\n\n{2. \\it Encryption.} Let $M$ be an information to be encrypted. Then\n$M$ must satisfy the inequality $M < \\sqrt{m}$. We compute the\ncyphertext as follows: $ r = a^M ~\\mod{m^2}, $ i.e., $r$ is the\nremainder when dividing $a^M$ by $m^2$.\n\n{3. \\it Deciphering.} To get the information $M$, we have to\ncalculate\n$\nM = \\frac{r^{p-1}-1}{p}n ~\\pmod p.\n${4. \\it The proof of correctness.} By assumption, $r \\equiv a^M \\mod\nm^2$.

It is impossible to find $n$ without knowing $p$, and the search\n   for $p$ is a hard-to compute factorization problem. However, knowing $p$, we can easily to obtain $n$ by solving the corresponding congruence.\n\n\\subsection{The second system}%\\begin{center}%\\textit{The second system}%\\end{center}\nHere, the same groups $ \\mathbb{N}_p^{(*)} \\times \\mathbb{N}^+$  and\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ play the roles of $G_1$ and $G_2$,\nrespectively.\n\n{1. \\it Key choice}.

We notice that    most well-known algorithms solving the problem need to check the\n primality after each iteration. An extra difficulty arises to chose among the primes obtained  a number\n for which $a$ is anti-Wieferich. Proof of the correctness of the cryptosystem is similar to the first case,\n only the corresponding lemma should be formulated as follows:\n\\begin{lemma}\nIf $a \\equiv b \\mod p^{s+1},$ then $l(a) \\equiv l(b) \\mod p^s.$\n\\end{lemma}\\subsection{Electronic signature}%\\begin{center}%\\textit{Electronic signature}%\\end{center}\nWe want to sign a message $\\bar{m} = m_1,... , m_n$.

Next, we choose a number $a, 1<a<p$ for a publicly known prime $p$ that is not a Wieferich number, i.e.,\n$\n\\frac{a^{p-1}-1}{p} \\not\\equiv 0 ~\\mod  p\n$\nand compute $n$ such that\n$\n\\frac{a^{p-1}-1}{p}n \\equiv 1 ~\\mod  p.\n$\nAfter that we take  $r = a^h ~\\mod{ p^2}$ and generate a signed message,\n$\n(\\bar{m}, r, n)~~~~~~~~ (\\text{or}\\; (\\bar{m}, r))\n$\nThe number $a$ is secret and is stored by us.
